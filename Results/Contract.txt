# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 

We will try to meet at least 1 (maybe 2) times a week. We’ve met a few times at the Grainger Library already so that will
probably be the designated place. Meeting should last between 1-2 hours. Additionally, we could meet by doing a group chat 
discord call. This is easiest because we can talk as a group while working at the same time. People can screenshare on discord also.

2. **Assistance** 

We will have each other’s contact information. We already have a few group chats (on Discord, Snapchat) and we even have
each other's' phone numbers. So if someone needs help with their work, they can ask on any of these platforms and should 
expect a response within an hour at most.

3. **Respect** 

All of us understand that it is in our best interest to turn in a quality final project that works successfully. We recognize
that to do so, we need to respect one another. We are open to other group members’ ideas as long as they seem plausible to accomplish.
If anyone has a problem with a group member, they can talk about it with the other group members.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 

The initial thought was to assign each person an algorithm/traversal to do. Ideally, this seems like a good idea, since we can’t 
always meet up every day of the week to work together. But it might be challenging if each person had their own task to do. However,
we think it would be a good idea to try this way out, and if people have problems or questions, they can contact other group members.
Or we could always meet up more if we feel it is appropriate and people are struggling.

5. **Time Commitment** 

All of us obviously have other class finals we need to study for. Each of us should be able to find some time during the week
where we can dedicate time to work on the project. We should each try to work at least 4 hours a week. It doesn’t have to be on
any specific day. Just as long as the effort is put into it each week.

6. **Conflict Resolution** 

If there is a disagreement between two members of the group, we will talk it out between everyone. If someone has not been doing
their work, we can first try talking to them and ask if they need help. If they do need help, we can help them. But if over and 
over a member has not been putting in the work or effort, we will contact the course staff.
